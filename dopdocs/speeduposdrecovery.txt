# Speed up or slow down osd backfilling

Situation
Customer needs to speed up or slow down osd backfilling.

This may happen when osd(s) are stopped or removed from the cluster.
It may also happenwhen osd(s) are added to the cluster. 

Also see:
https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/dev/osd_internals/backfill_reservation/
 
You can also set these values if you want a quick recovery for your cluster, helping OSDs to perform recovery faster.

    osd max backfills: This is the maximum number of backfill operations allowed to/from OSD. The higher the number, the quicker the recovery, which might impact overall cluster performance until recovery finishes. 
    osd recovery max active: This is the maximum number of active recover requests. Higher the number, quicker the recovery, which might impact the overall cluster performance until recovery finishes. 
    osd recovery op priority: This is the priority set for recovery operation. Lower the number, higher the recovery priority. Higher recovery priority might cause performance degradation until recovery completes. 

Keep in mind that changing these values can impact the performance of cluster.  Clients may see slower response.  

Default Values:
ceph-admin:~ # ceph config --show-config | egrep "osd_recovery_max_active|osd_recovery_op_priority|osd_max_backfills"
osd_max_backfills = 1
osd_recovery_max_active = 3
osd_recovery_op_priority = 3
Resolution
The following command appears to be sufficient to speed up backfilling/recovery.  On the Admin node run:
ceph tell 'osd.*' injectargs --osd-max-backfills=2 --osd-recovery-max-active=6
or 
ceph tell 'osd.*' injectargs --osd-max-backfills=3 --osd-recovery-max-active=9

To set back to default, run:
ceph tell 'osd.*' injectargs --osd-max-backfills=1 --osd-recovery-max-active=3

"ceph config set" also works with SES 6:
ceph config set osd osd_max_backfills 2
ceph config set osd osd_recovery_max_active 3

To set back to default run:
ceph config rm osd osd_recovery_max_active
ceph config rm osd osd_max_backfills

Setting the values to high can cause osd's to restart, causing the cluster to become unstable.

Monitor with "ceph -s".
If osd's start restarting, then reduce the values.
If clients are impacted by the recovery, reduce the values.
To slow down  recovery, reduce values to default.  
When cluster is healty set values back to default. 
Cause
Cluster is backfilling and the administrator wishes to over ride defaults to speed up or slow down backfilling.
